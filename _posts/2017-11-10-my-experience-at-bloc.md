This is my first blog post.  I always thought writing a blog post would be similar to writing in a journal or diary, but the entry is made public.  I've always been a private person and I really don't plan on changing anytime relatively soon, however I feel I can share my thoughts on my experience with Bloc on the Web Developer track.  

#### They are not joking
I am one-third of the way through the program and my initial thoughts are _wow there is definitely truth in advertising._  The Admissions Counselors, Orientation Leaders and even my Mentor all said you need to give a 100% commitment to the program if you want to succeed and complete the program, on time.  All of the orientation material said that there will be moments of uncertainty and doubt while moving through the program.  I wasn't prepared for those moments so early on.  I figured they would ease me into the program and progressively increase the difficulty. The first few checkpoints did have an initial orientation to HTML, CSS and a brief introduction to Javascript.  Then they really cranked up the difficulty and have not stopped.  Every checkpoint appears to build on the previous checkpoint, however not everything in the checkpoint is explained thoroughly and it is up to you to _sink or swim_ by finding the answer to solve the problem in front of you.

#### Old dog learning new tricks
Part of **my** problem is that I'm older than the typical student and I think my way of learning is slightly different than how the material is being presented.  I have a great Mentor and I can honestly say all of my success, to this point, is due to his patience, dedication and the approach he uses with me. I find the Mentor sessions extremely useful, they have a way of guiding me to a solution that I would have spent weeks trying to find the answer.  I would suggest keeping all of your appointments with your Mentor and come prepared with your questions.  This is the best way to guarantee success while working on your checkpoints until your next meeting.

### Experience so familiar
I feel there could be a little more explanation accompanied with the checkpoints, however, with that being said, I feel like I am better prepared to research answers to upcoming projects.  Even though, I'm only one-third of the way through the program, I would and will definitely recommend it to anyone with who is serious about becoming a web developer.
