title: "My Frontend Developer Goals"

As a frontend developer my goals are simple.  

* Get a job creating websites
* Assist with creating website in a company
* Create companion applications for existing apps

I'm know these goals are grand and vague but I am only one-third of the way through the web development program and I'm not completely certain which path I'm going to take.  

#### Creating websites
I am a fan of creating something, such a s a web pages, that provides a service, such as knowledge gathering for visitors to use and re-visit.  In my current position, I created a knowledge base for users to find answers to frequently asked questions they have concerning my organization.  I also really enjoy the continued improvement process.  I can see myself working with a company to distribute information and/or knowledge regarding their products.  I can also see creating a web site from scratch that is inviting, easy to use and makes the visitor want to return.

#### Assisting on websites
I can also see myself working with others to improve upon an existing website.  Working on a new feature or an updated version of an existing section is also appealing.  I like having a roadmap and knowing the logistics of a project before starting my work.  An existing company should have a working roadmap or project plan.  I also enjoy collaborating with other on projects.  I feel I do my best work when working with others.  Creativity just seems to flow better when the ideas are floating around.

#### Companion apps
One thing I would really like to do is work to enhance other applications through API integration.  I would have to say this concept excites me the most about becoming a web developer.  It is also my weakest area.  I don't know much, if anything, about APIs and I have not had a natural gravitation towards programming.  I'm hoping and anticipating all of this changing as I progress further through the program.  

I'm confident that I can accomplish any and all of my goals after I complete this program and become a web developer.
