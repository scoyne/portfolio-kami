BlocJams was my introduction to web design and programming.  This was my first time programming with Javascript and jQuery.  I was not prepared.  I have created web pages in the past using HTML and CSS, however the sheer size and scope of the project was well past my level of expertise, even with the basics.  

#### The Assignment
The assignment was simple, create an all encompassing music streaming website, similar to Spotify.  The roadmap was defined in the beginning.  Every checkpoint built on the previous part.  In the end, I created a working music player, although it is noting like Spotify and more like a personal music inventory player.  I am satisfied with my work and the finished product.  It's not half bad for my first time.

#### The Challenges
The challenges came in the form of the checkpoint and assignment combination.  The checkpoint would guide me through several complicated steps, but it never really explained _the why_ and I was left with following instructions.  Then came the assignments.  The assignments that followed the checkpoint gave instructions for improving upon the checkpoint, however the assignment did not provide any assistance, like the checkpoint, and I was left to search and find solutions on the internet.  Sometimes I was able to find a solution, other times I needed to discuss with my mentor the right way to do things and some times I looked at the bloc solution just to find out what I was trying to accomplish.  I rarely used the last option, but it did come in handy towards some of the later assignments.

In the end, I feel the entire project was a challenge.  One that I am glad to be finished with and grateful for the experience of going through the basic anguishes a web developer faces on their projects.  I don't feel that I have learned as much as I should have and I an in no way ready for a job in this field.  My takeaway from BlocJams is that I got through it and it made me a more resilient student.  I am ready for my next challenge.
