## Summary

Music soothes the savage beast.  There are several options when it comes to your music.  Streaming service like Spotify and Pandora make it easy for you to discover new music, but there are very few options that give you complete control over your own music.  BlocJams give you full control over uploading, organizing and displaying your music, your way.

## Explanation

Music is personal and BlocJams is a digital music player, similar to Spotify, that provides full control over your music.  BlocJams can can be used to organize and listen to **your** favorite music. BlocJams is website coded using HTML, CSS and Javascript.  It was a project used to introduce frontend design and development, but it became much more.  It became a beloved project that tested my resolve and my dedication to becoming a web developer.  

## Problem

The problem was building a website that will display album information in an organized manner while also playing the music it is representing.  This was a big problem because the project required working knowledge of Javascript, jQuery, CSS and other frameworks that I was not familiar.  

## Solution

My solution was to break each piece of the project in to small manageable sections.  The master roadmap or finished product was always available to refer to, however each smaller section had its own clearly defined requirements that when complete, fit nicely in to the master roadmap.  Breaking the web pieces made the project manageable and enjoyable, at times.

## Results

The result of this project was a successful, functioning music player.  Testing at every step was vital to the success of this project.  Being able to test each piece of the project and not proceeding until the code was error free made the project smoothly because you did not have to worry about the previous section you worked on.  If there was an error in the code, that caused the program to "break", being able rollback to a previous version of the project allowed more freedom to experiment with different methods before landing on the final piece of code.

## Conclusion

This project tested my abilities and a little of my sanity.  It was demanding, frustrating and exhilarating.  I feel better about my coding abilities and I'm excited to move on to the next project.

#### What worked
 - Outlining the project with a clearly defined roadmap
 - Version control was extremely useful, especially after mistakes
 - Suggested solutions at the end of every checkpoint

 #### What did not worked
 - Providing the roadmap, with tutorial, without full explanations of procedures. A lot was taken on faith
 - I'm still not completely confident with my coding skills
 - There could have been more music choices
